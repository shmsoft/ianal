# ianal

ianal stands for "I am not a lawyer", see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL)

The goal of the projects is to write code that will answer legal questions.

In so doing, it will use IA and Machine learning. It will also draw on other sources.
For example, it may get its information from

* [WestLaw](http://next.westlaw.com)
* IBM Dr. Watson (see [here](https://medium.com/cognitivebusiness/how-watson-helps-lawyers-find-answers-in-legal-research-672ea028dfb8) for starters)
* [Google NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)

Some of these are licensed and for-pay services, and ianal would use the user's credentials.
